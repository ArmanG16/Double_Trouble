## Double Trouble Game:
Double Trouble is a simple game where you and the computer take turns removing markers from three different colors: green, yellow, and orange. 
The game ends when all the markers are removed, and the player who removes the last marker wins. The computer uses both smart strategies and random moves to make 
the game more interesting.

The game allows:
- The user to decide who goes first and enter moves.
- The computer to make strategic moves when possible or random moves if there isnâ€™t a clear strategy.

## What I Learned:
1. **Game Strategy**: I learned how the nim-sum strategy works, which helps the computer decide on the best move to win.
2. **Random Moves**: I learned how to program random moves for the computer to make the game unpredictable.
3. **Java Basics**: I got more practice with using `Scanner` for input, working with loops and if-statements, and making sure the game runs smoothly from start to finish.
4. **Organizing Code**: I broke the game into smaller pieces (methods) so the code is easier to read and manage.
